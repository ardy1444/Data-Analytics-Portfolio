# Data Analytics Portfolio :bar_chart: :chart_with_upwards_trend:

Welcome to my Data Analytics Portfolio! :wave: This repository showcases my skills in extracting insights from data, with a particular emphasis on advanced analytics using Generative AI, as well as presenting data in a visually compelling manner.

## :robot: Generative AI for Contract Analytics :briefcase:

The `Generative AI` folder contains a Jupyter notebook `Contract_Risk_Analysis.ipynb` that demonstrates my skills in contract analytics. This project is at the forefront of applying Generative AI techniques to identify and mitigate potential risks in contract language.

Highlights of this project include:

- Utilizing Generative AI to dissect contract language and extract key clauses.
- Applying natural language processing techniques to assess risk levels and suggest modifications.
- Showcasing the ability to turn unstructured contract text into actionable insights.

This innovative work illustrates my expertise in harnessing the power of AI for complex data analysis tasks.

## :policeman: Police Shooting Analysis :policewoman:

In this analysis, we delve into a dataset of police shooting incidents in the United States. We examine factors such as the use of body cameras, racial disparities, and geographic patterns. The R Markdown file `Police_Shooting_Analysis.Rmd` provides a full exploration.

Some key insights from this analysis include:

- The use of body cameras in incidents varies significantly across different cities. :video_camera:
- Racial disparities in incidents point to the need for tailored strategies. :diversity_flag:
- Incident trends over time suggest varying underlying dynamics. :time:

This analysis highlights my ability to conduct comprehensive data exploration and create insightful visualizations in R.

## :snake: Micro Analyses in Python :bar_chart:

Here, I present a series of smaller analyses performed in Python, demonstrating my proficiency with data visualization libraries such as Matplotlib and Seaborn.

## :handshake: Collaboration and Contributions

I am open to collaborations and eager to improve my code. If you have suggestions or improvements, please open an issue or submit a pull request.
