# Data Analytics Portfolio :bar_chart: :chart_with_upwards_trend:

Welcome to my Data Analytics Portfolio! :wave: This repository showcases my ability to extract insights from data and present them in a visually compelling manner. It includes a range of projects, from micro analyses in Python to a comprehensive study of police shooting data.

## :policeman: Police Shooting Analysis :policewoman:

In this analysis, we dive deep into a dataset of police shooting incidents in the United States. We explore various factors such as the use of body cameras, racial disparities, geographic patterns, and more. The R Markdown file `Police_Shooting_Analysis.Rmd` contains all the details.

Some key insights from this analysis include:

- The use of body cameras in incidents involving individuals armed with something other than a gun varies significantly across different cities. :video_camera:
- There are clear racial disparities in the incidents across different cities, indicating a need for strategies tailored to these disparities. :diversity_flag:
- The trend of incidents over time varies across different cities, suggesting different underlying dynamics and influences. :time:

This analysis demonstrates my ability to perform comprehensive data exploration and visualizations in R. 

## :snake: Micro Analyses in Python :bar_chart:

This section showcases a collection of smaller analyses conducted in Python, demonstrating Python data visualization libraries like Matplotlib and Seaborn.
